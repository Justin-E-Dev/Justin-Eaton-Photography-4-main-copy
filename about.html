        <p class="paragraph-1">My name is Justin. I am a photographer within the Pittsburgh, PA region. I specialize in landscape photography. My greatest joy in terms of photography is to venture around the city of Pittsburgh to showcase its unique character. I was raised in Beaver County and while living there, I had the pleasure of representing my most favorite places to visit. Ever since I was a kid, I would be drawn to countless creative processes. Photography is an art that I have pursued with more persistence than any other kind. I have an obsession with the entire process, so much that I could not live happily without it!

          What I value most in my work is that it resembles home to many people in Pittsburgh. I try to capture spots/moments in the city where observers can feel a heartfelt reminder of what home really is. Pittsburgh has beautiful self-identifying bridges and buildings, only found in Pittsburgh. These landmarks have stood in the midst of so many historical events. Photographing what so many others can feel connected to is an invigorating privilege. While doing this, I get to think about how I can artistically draw-in observers through an emotional level. Photography has endless possibilities! I hope that my passions interest you, and that I can present photographs that will evoke some pleasant memories of the city of Pittsburugh and its surrounding areas.
